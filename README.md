This Project is for Data Mining Course (21-019) which is an undergraduate course in Industrial Engineering Department at Sharif University of Technology. We got the Spotify Data from Kaggle. The datasets have information about tracks and atrists in about 100 years and the goal was to predict the popularity of a track by its features. 
Before doing anything, we cleaned the data and did a lot of feature engineering to the data so we can have a rich and clean dataset for the analysis. 
Then, we tried to predict the exact popularity index with different regression models and the best R2 score that we got was about 60 %. 
Then, we classified the popularity in 4 categories and used different classification models and the best F1-Score was about 80 %.
